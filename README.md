# Sales predictions and inventory management

Nowadays, forecasting has become a very popular and efficient tool in operations as companies are always trying to minimize cost or maximize profit. Although they might seem to be the same goal, but in more complex business operations they can add constraints to each other. And this is when having a good estimate of the variables that drive your operations can help make better trade-off.

This project will showcase how Data Science tools can efficiently handle random distributions. The focus will be on forecasting sales for a Grocery retailer. The challenge is to model the behaviors of 1782 times series.

You will find a presentation of the results in PowerPoint format as well as considerations and codes used to elaborate the model in Python.

# Context

The project is done with a dataset made available by Kaggle for free. It relates the sales history of a large grocery retailer from 2013 to 2017.

# Improvement

Ways to improve the model:

1 - More information from the company can help put the values into context and therefore increase the performance of the model.

2 - A case-by-case analysis will drive to better results. So, in a real-life problem-solving situation you will find constraints that will lead to considerations for a case-by-case analysis.

# Files structure
1 - data directory: contains .csv files.

2 - python files directory: contains .py files to run.

3 - final project presentation is a PowerPoint files that gives a summary on the model. performance.

4 - monthy_analysis.ipynb contains all codes for monthly forecast analysis.

5 - sarimax.ipynb contains all codes for daily forecast analysis.

6 - features_extraction.ipynb contains all code used to extract fearures from the dataset.
